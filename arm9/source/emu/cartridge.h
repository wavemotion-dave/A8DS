/*
 * CARTRIDGE.C contains a subset of Atari800 cart support. The A8DS emulator
 * is targeting XEX and ATR files... We are partially supporting the use of
 * CAR (with 16-byte headers) and ROM (headerless... these are flat binary files).
 * 
 * The baseline for this file is the Atari800 2.0.x source and has
 * been heavily modified for optimization on the Nintendo DS/DSi.
 * Atari800 has undergone numerous improvements and enhancements
 * since the time this file was used as a baseline for A8DS and 
 * it is strongly ecommended that you seek out the latest Atari800 sources.
